This project was created on the order of a customer engaged in the repair of apartments. There is no great logic in this project. The entire project, together with the design, was created by me. Thanks to EmailJS, it is possible to send a message to the client directly to his email, be it a call order or any question. SweetAlert was used to notify the user about the successful sending of his message, as well as to display the QR code of the client's social network. The following was used to create this project: ReactJS, Material UI, SwiperJS, SweetAlert, EmailJS, React functional components and their reusability.

This app is fully responsive.

Setup: run npm i ,
       npm start -
       to start the development server
